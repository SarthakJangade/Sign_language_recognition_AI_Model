***Sign Language Recognition Project***
This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of recognizing sign language from either video or image data. This technology has the potential to:

Improve communication accessibility for deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals by bridging the gap between spoken and signed languages.


Create assistive technologies like automated translation tools and educational resources.


Advance research in human-computer interaction by allowing computers to understand and respond to nonverbal communication.



**Key Features:-**


Image and video processing: Analyze hand postures, movements, and facial expressions within video or images.


Machine learning models: Utilize deep learning techniques like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to recognize signs accurately.


Real-time recognition: Process data in real-time, enabling immediate translation or interaction.


Customization: Adapt the model to different sign languages and individual signing styles.



**Examples:-**


Real-time translation of sign language into spoken language during conversations or presentations.


Educational applications that help children learn sign language or deaf children learn spoken language.


Interactive games or experiences controlled by sign language gestures.
